- âš¡ Fun fact: The term "pixel" is a combination of "picture" and "element." It was first coined by Frederic C. Billingsley, an engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in 1965. The concept of pixels is fundamental to digital imaging, where images are composed of individual picture elements, each representing a tiny dot of color.
